#Instructions

#There is a bus moving in the city, and it takes and drop some people in each bus stop.
#You are provided with a list (or array) of integer arrays (or tuples). 
#Each integer array has two items which represent number of people get into bus (The first item) 
#    and number of people get off the bus (The second item) in a bus stop.

#Your task is to return number of people who are still in the bus after the last bus station (after the last array). 
#Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus is not empty and some people are still in the bus, 
#    and they are probably sleeping there :D


def number(bus_stops):
    people_on_bus = 0
    for a, b in bus_stops:
        people_on_bus += (a - b)
    return people_on_bus
