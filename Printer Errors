#Instructions:

#In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. 
#For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

#The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. 
#For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, 
#four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...

#Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced 
#e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

#You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will output the error rate of the printer 
#as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length 
#of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

#The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.

def printer_error(s):
    colors = ('a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j','k','l','m')
    errors = 0
    for i in s:
        if i not in colors:
            errors += 1
    return '{}/{}'.format(errors, len(s))
    
    
#winning_solution
#from re import sub
#def printer_error(s):
    #return "{}/{}".format(len(sub("[a-m]",'',s)),len(s))
