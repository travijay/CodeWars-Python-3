# Introduction
#The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! 
#There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. 
#Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollars bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.

#Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.

#Can Vasya sell a ticket to each person and give the change if he initially has no money and sells the 
#tickets strictly in the order people follow in the line?

#Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to each person and give the change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. 
#Otherwise return NO.
